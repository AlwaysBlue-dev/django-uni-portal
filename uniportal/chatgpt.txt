this is function:
  students = Student.objects.all()
    student_data = {
        'student_name': [student.student_name for student in students],
        'student_batch': [student.student_batch for student in students],
        'student_enrol_no': [student.student_enrol_no for student in students],
        'pub_date': [student.pub_date for student in students]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(student_data)
    
    # Use Seaborn to visualize the data
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    sns.countplot(x='student_batch', data=df)
    
    # Save the plot to an image file
    plot_path = os.path.join(settings.STATIC_ROOT, 'plot.png')
    plt.savefig(plot_path)
    
    return render(request, 'plot.html')

This is my template code:
<img src="/staticfiles/plot.png" alt="plot">

The image is not shown on the web page and shows the alt message and I already configured the static correctly in my setting.py

this my setting.py configuration

STATIC_URL = '/static/'

BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent

# Add Manually
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
There are a few things that you can try to resolve the issue with the image not being displayed on your web page:

Check if the path to the image file is correct in your template. The path in your template is /staticfiles/plot.png, but your STATIC_ROOT in settings.py is set to os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles'). Ensure that these paths match.

Verify that the image file has been correctly saved in the STATIC_ROOT directory. You can use the command line to navigate to the directory and check if the file is present.

Make sure that the django.contrib.staticfiles app is installed and included in your INSTALLED_APPS list in settings.py.

Ensure that the django.contrib.staticfiles.urls module is included in your urls.py file.

If you are running the development server, make sure that the django.contrib.staticfiles.views.serve view is added to your urls.py file to handle serving static files during development.

Try these steps and see if it resolves the issue. If not, you can provide more details about the error message you are receiving.
